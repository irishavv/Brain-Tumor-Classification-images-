# Brain Tumor Classification ðŸ§ 

Author- Rishav kumar

## Overview

This project aims to classify brain tumors using MRI images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can build a model that accurately identifies different types of brain tumors. This can assist medical professionals in diagnosing and planning treatment more effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of MRI images labeled with different types of brain tumors. Each image is categorized into one of the following classes:

- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary**
- **No Tumor**

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load the MRI images and understand their structure.
   - Perform basic statistical analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Resize images to a consistent size.
   - Normalize pixel values.
   - Augment data to increase the diversity of the training set.

3. **Model Training**
   - Build and compile a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
   - Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
   - Use techniques like early stopping and model checkpointing.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
   - Generate classification reports and confusion matrices.
   - Visualize the model's give response its yes or no.

## Results
Provide Images and model will give yes or no result
